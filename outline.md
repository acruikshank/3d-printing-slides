# 3d Printer

A machine that converts computer generated 3d shapes into physical objects.

# History

* Invented in 1980's - Mostly for Industrial use
* 2005 Reprap project started - Hobyists building their own
* 2009 First commercial kits (Makerbot, Ultimaker, Cubify, Printrbot, etc.)

# Types of 3d printing

* Stereo Lithography
* Extrusion Deposition
* Granular materials binding
* Concrete?

# 3d Printing Process

* Build the model in software
** Vertices and Faces
** Same process and similar tools to 3d animated movies
** Generate STL file
* Run the model through a Slicer
** Cut image up into 2d shapes (slices)
** Determine a path to fill each shape.
** Generate g code
* Run the g code in the printer

# How it works

* Heater in the nozzle to melt the plastic
* One motor adjusts the height of the bed
* Two motors (x and y axis) move the nozzle across the bed.
* One motor feeds the filiment into the nozzle.
* Extrudes a line on bed until shape is filled.
* Drops bed one level.
* Extredes another line on top of the previous shape.

# Printing is Hard

* Thinking and drawing in 3d is hard
* It's slow
* Overhangs
* Clogs, loose belts, etc.

# How to get started

* Buy a printer
* Go to the Library
* Shapeways

# How to model

* Thingiverse
* Tinkercad
* Sketchup
* AutoCAD, SolidWorks, etc.
* Program it
